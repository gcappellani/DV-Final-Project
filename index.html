            <br>
            Eminem, also known as Marshall Mathers, is widely known to be one of the greatest rapper of all time
            and is one of the few rappers coming from the 1990’s rap scene still producing and performing. Born
            in October 17th 1972, Eminem reached up to the top just 3 years after its first home-made album was
            released, and is now about to turn 50 soon. From the point of view of a huge fan it is hard to see its fa-
            vorite rapper getting old and the kind of questions one in this situation will likely have running into their
            mind are: is age affecting Eminem’s style? Its energy? Its danceability? Its productivity?
            <br>
            <br>
            And what about its impact on the rap scene? Is it still huge as it was back in time? And if not, what are
            the causes that determined such changes? And how those are related to its age? This project, with th
            e help of a great dataset collected via the Spotify API, aims to provide insights on what could be the a
            nswers for all those kind of questions.

            <br>
            So lets first take a look on the Eminem's style, to better understand how it is characterized and how those
            characteristics are related to each other. The Spotify API here does the job, providing us outstanding features
            for any track in Eminem's albums released so far, for more information about them visit the
            <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-features">Spotify API documentation</a>.
            Here we plot some of them together, in an interactive 4D
            bubblechart (interaction will be added in beta release) for you to explore Eminem's style in terms of:<br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Acousticness</strong>: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic.</li>
                <li><strong>Danceability</strong>: How suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo,
                    rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy</strong>: Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud,
                    and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.</li>
                <li><strong>Loudness</strong>: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire
                    track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks.</li>
                <li><strong>Speechiness</strong>: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like
                    the recording the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks
                    that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music.<br></li>
                <li><strong>Tempo</strong>: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM).</li>
                <li><strong>Positiveness</strong>: A measure describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track.
                    Tracks with high value sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low value
                    sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

        <div style="margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 200px; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; text-anchor: middle; line-height: 1.4em">
            <br>
            <br>
            Now that we have a general idea of how it is characterized the Eminem's style the next thing we would like to see
            is what are the differences between one album to the other, which brings us to the next question: how are those features changing overtime?<br>
            <br>
            Here we group the tracks by album, we wrap them in boxes and we present them to you in an interactive (on beta release) plot.

        </iframe>
        <div style="margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 200px; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; text-anchor: middle; line-height: 1.4em">
            Now that we have navigated through Eminem's style and its changing overtime, there is one last question still unresolved:
            how his public is reacting to those changes? And how is Eminem trying to connect with his fans? Is he producing more?
            Is he live-perfoming more?<br>
            <br>
            Again, the Spotify API comes into help in this, providing us the following features:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tracks per album</strong>: The number of tracks released on each album.</li>
                <li><strong>Liveness</strong>: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability
                    that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.</li>
                <li><strong>Sales in the US</strong>: The number of sold discs in the US per each album.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
        </div>
        <iframe src="linecharts.html" name="targetframe" allowTransparency="true" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="650" width="1000" >
        </iframe>
        <br>
        <div style="margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 200px; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 200; text-anchor: middle; line-height: 1.4em">
            Data speaks clear on this, while Eminem productivity is slowly reducing overtime, its liveness seems increasing overall.
            For what regards its sales instead, results outstands way more clearly, even though there is one thing to mention, which is the
            uprising of the music streaming platforms, like Spotify.<br>
            <br>
            In fact, Spotify, founded in 2006, starts becoming popular in 2011, reducing so the number of physical-disc sales all over the world.
            Anyway, the drop we see in between 2002-2009 should make us think, not casually Eminem's 6th album released in 2010 has been named 'Recovery'.
